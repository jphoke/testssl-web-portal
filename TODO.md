##Changes to work through
- Critical Fixes
    - ~~Fix issues with how worker.py calls testssh.sh as it does not clean up bash processes, leading to zombie processes on linux and could cause DOS~~ ✓
    - ~~Fix grading. Use the grades from testssl.sh (A+, A, A-, B - F, M, T) if possible. Properly colorcode the output of grades on UI~~ ✓
    - ~~Fix coloring of testssl failures (use of SSLv2/3, TLS1.0, 1.1 should be red for failures)~~ ✓
    - ~~Fix coloring of obsoleted ciphers offered (should show as failure)~~ ✓
    - ~~Fix nginx permission issues in frontend container~~ ✓
    - ~~Fix Celery spawning too many worker processes on high-CPU systems~~ ✓
    - ~~Fix zombie bash processes with Docker init system~~ ✓
    - ~~Database Security: Enforce strong passwords in deployment scripts~~ ✓
    - ~~Add timeout handling for stuck scans~~ ✓ (already implemented with 600s timeout)
    - ~~Add logic to fail test when the scan fails due to inability to reach host~~ ✓
    - ~~Ensure proper error messages when testssl.sh fails~~ ✓
    - ~~**Command Injection Prevention**: Add additional input sanitization for host:port before passing to testssl.sh~~ ✓
    - **Resource Limits**: Implement limits on concurrent scans per IP, reduce timeout from 600s to 120s, add disk quota monitoring
- Security Improvements (Moderate Risk)
    - Review CORS configuration - currently allows all origins (allow_origins=["*"]) which enables CSRF attacks. Should remove CORS middleware entirely since nginx proxy handles same-origin requests
    - ~~**Information Disclosure**: Replace detailed error messages with generic ones for users, log detailed errors server-side only~~ ✓
    - **Security Headers**: Add X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy headers
    - **Session Management**: Implement proper session handling with secure cookies and CSRF protection
- Performance Improvements
    - Investigate if the speed of the testssl.sh runs can be improved
    - Add concurrent scan limits to prevent resource exhaustion
    - Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks:
        - Nginx rate limiting: 2 scans/minute per IP for POST /api/scans
        - Status endpoint: 60 requests/minute per IP for polling
        - General API: 120 requests/minute per IP
        - Consider optimizing frontend polling intervals (currently 2s constant)
- Code Quality/Refactoring
    - Add comprehensive logging
    - Unit tests for critical functions
    - Input validation improvements
- Feature Enhancements
    - ~~Add scanID from database to the output of recent scans~~ ✓
    - Add Authentication options (MS EntraID, MS Active Directory/LDAP, others?) as an optional configuration
    - Add other protocols to test TLS on (STARTTLS options from testssl.sh)
    - Export functionality (PDF/CSV reports)
    - Scheduled/recurring scans
    - API endpoint for programmatic access
    - Email notifications for completed scans
    - Scan comparison (before/after)
    - WebSocket support for real-time scan updates (instead of polling)
    - Dark mode theme support
    - Add ability to test other TLS implementations supported by testssl.sh using STARTTLS, etc.
    - Add logging of IP Address of client device requesting scan to database
    - ~~Add "Notes" field to capture notes if necessary, capture note to DB (short note limit < 100 characters) with input validations~~ ✓
    - Add configurable application overrides for TLS configurations that cause failure e.g.: use of TLS 1.0 is an auto-fail, etc.
